# Citation Verification Protocol

For each claim:

## A) Existence
- Can the source be found?
- Is the title/author/year/journal correct?

## B) Attribution
- Is the citation attached to the correct claim?
- Is it the right section/page/figure?

## C) Support
- Does the source actually support the claim?
- If it partially supports, mark as partial support and treat as not fully supported for strict tiers.

Record:
- claim text
- citation text
- verification result (pass/fail/partial)
- short note explaining why
