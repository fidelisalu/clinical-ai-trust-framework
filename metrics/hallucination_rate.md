# Hallucination Rate (HR)

HR quantifies unsupported claims.

## Definition
A claim is hallucinated if it is presented as factual and:
- has no citation, OR
- has a citation that does not support it, OR
- is contradicted by the cited evidence.

## Formula
HR = (# Hallucinated Claims) / N

Lower is better.

## Guidance (suggested)
- Tier 1: HR ≤ 0.10
- Tier 2: HR ≤ 0.05
- Tier 3: HR ≤ 0.01
