# FAQ

## Is CATF a regulatory certification?
No. CATF is an evaluation framework and does not replace FDA or clinical governance processes.

## Why risk tiers?
Because harm is not uniform. Wrong dosage advice is more dangerous than a definition.

## Can this be used beyond LLMs?
Yes—any clinical AI system producing recommendations can be evaluated.
